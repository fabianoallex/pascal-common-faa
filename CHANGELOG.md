# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While the version is 0.x, a minor version
may change the API; each such change is listed here. From 1.0 on, a minor version only adds.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton: `pascalcommon.inc`, Lazarus package `pascal_common_faa.lpk`, DUnitX and
  FPCUnit runners (the FPCUnit fixtures generated from the DUnitX masters by
  `tools/gen_fpc_mirror.py`), test scripts for Windows and Linux (Docker) and CI.
- `PascalCommon.Version`: `PASCALCOMMON_VERSION` (major × 10000 + minor × 100 + patch) for
  consumers' compile-time minimum-version checks.
